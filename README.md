# CS235-Maze-Solver


## About the Project

* In this project we were given three mazes in two formats: A csv file used in the program and a png file used for a visual aid
* We were tasked by finding the path from beginning to end of the maze using three algorithms
1. Breadth-first search algorithm
2. Depth-first search algorithm
3. Dead-end filling algorithm

## Project Design

* Solutions.cpp file containing all the algorithms

## Algorithmic Analysis
### Test

## How To Compile the Program

1. Download the files and put them in a directory
2. Navigate to your directory in your terminal and run the command
> g++ main.cpp -o main
3. To execute the program run the command
> ./main
4. By default, the program will solve the first maze using the Depth-first search alogirthm, to solve other mazes with any algorithm, please enter the "main.cpp" file where there are additional instructions
